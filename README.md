# MarsWeather

I challenged myself to make a little weather app using NASA’s Insight Weather API. As with most things I started pulling out all the docs and information to get my mind wrapped around what I was getting from the API to work with. And after looking at the docs for a bit I realized that one of the best ways for me to get my mind wrapped around the data was to apply the ORCA process I’ve been learning.
